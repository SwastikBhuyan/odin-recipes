    <h4>Steps</h4>

    <ol>
        <li>In a bowl, mix together 1/2 cup yogurt, 1/2 cup milk, salt, and 1 tbsp black pepper. Marinate chicken pieces in it for 3 to 4 hours or even overnight. (You can add more yogurt and milk if needed.)</li>
        <li>In another small bowl, mix together 1 egg white and 1/2 cup milk.</li>
        <li>In a large tray or bowl, mix together 2 cups plain flour, 1 tbsp cornflour, 1 tsp garlic powder, 1 tsp onion powder, 1 tbsp red chili powder, 1/2 tsp garam masala powder, 1/2 tsp dried oregano, 1 tbsp brown sugar, 1 tbsp black pepper powder, and salt.</li>
        <li>Heat cooking oil in a large wok for deep frying.</li>
        <li>Remove chicken pieces from the marinade and roll each piece into the plain flour-spice mixture first, then dip into the egg white – milk mixture, and again into the plain flour-spice mixture.</li>
        <li>Once the oil is hot, reduce the flame to medium and fry chicken pieces one by one. Do not overcrowd the wok.</li>
        <li>Fry chicken pieces for about 12 to 15 minutes (12 minutes for small pieces).</li>
        <li>Remove the pieces and place them on a wire rack for the excess oil to drain out.</li>
        <li>Serve hot.</li>
